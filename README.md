# NasaPI
A webpage which displays data from multiple different Nasa API's. 
The intention of this website is not to be the most visually spectacular, but rather show a strong understanding of json API's through Javascript.
There are a number of very dense and data-rich API's which have been used to build this website, including data on Asteroids, Weather and Satelites. 
There are a number of mathematical aspects to this website such as dynamic: plots, scales(size of asteroids), diagrams and websites. Showing a strong understanding of mathematics applied in programming.

-The Single Prerequest is that the user disables CORS on their browser or through some other forms. As much of the data will not load otherwsie. All linked API's are from NASA and NASA alone. Remeber to reenable CORS once you are done reviewing this project.
