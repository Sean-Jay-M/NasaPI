# NasaPI
A webpage which displays data from multiple different Nasa API's. 

The intention of this website is not to be the most visually spectacular, but rather to further gain an understanding of json API's and Javascript.

There are a number of very dense and data-rich API's which have been used to build this website, including data on Asteroids, Weather and Satelites, provided by NASA.

There are a number of mathematical aspects to this website such as dynamic: plots, scales(size of asteroids) and diagrams. This was done to further my own understanding of how to implement mathematical logic in JavaScript and programming in general. One goal of this website was to NOT use any libraries (Although this rule was broken for a single instance), in order to display creativity in approach. While there are many parts of the website which could most definitely of been done better wit ha library, the usage of a library in this instance defeats the purpose of attempting to show my own abilities in the areas of focus.

-The Single Prerequest is that the user disables CORS on their browser or through some other forms. As much of the data will not load otherwsie. All linked API's are from NASA and NASA alone. Remeber to reenable CORS once you are done reviewing this project.

-The service is currently incomplete due to a problem with the Insight rover on mars and time constraints preventing me from finishing this project.

-To run simply download and open index.html.
