# NasaPI
A simple webpage which displays data from multiple different Nasa API's which carry JSON Data. 

The intention of this website is not to be the most visually spectacular, but rather to further gain and show an understanding of json API's and Javascript.

There are a number of very dense and data-rich API's which have been used to build this website, including data on Asteroids, Weather and Satelites, provided by NASA.

There are a number of mathematical aspects to this website such as dynamic: plots, scales(size of asteroids) and diagrams. This was done to further my own understanding of how to implement mathematical logic in JavaScript. This was constructed without the use of any frameworks.

# To Run

- Disable CORS.

- Download and open index.html.

# Notes

- The Weather API was never finished due to the Rover on Mars itself encountering difficulties and the API subsequently not producing any data, it is left in this application in case it ever functions again. 
- 'Solar System Dynamics and Center for Near-Earth Object Studies' and 'Near Earth Object Web Service' display the most complex data in this project. All graphs were coded by me without the use of Libraries, they are dynamic and alter based on the information which is being fed to them.
